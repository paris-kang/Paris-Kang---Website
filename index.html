        <div class="subheading mb-5">Child PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm currently doing child psychology due to my goals of becoming a pediatrician. I originally wanted to do my studies in biology because I was told that it was more beneficial and broad for any medical career, in this case it being pediatrics. After doing my research and meeting with career advisors, I was able to settle with psychology since it goes hand in hand with pediatrics. I was able to learn that psychology has various different branches, which includes child psychology. I've taken about two general classes for psychology, yet I was able to learn the things I needed to know as a kickstart to child psychology. Getting a degree in child psychology would be a starting point for me in terms of my career pathway. I plan on applying for internships and possibly shadowing child psychologists soon. After graduating with a BA in psychology, I hope to be in medical school, receive my residency and doctorate degrees, and be a pediatrician within the next 10 years.<br><br>

        My job experiences include working at a cafe restaurant for about a year before starting college. I started off as a barista, where I learned to make boba tea and smoothies. There, I would be in charge of cleaning our kitchen equipment, refilling toppings, making new batches of teas, making some of our toppings such as the honey boba or caramel custard, and wipe or mop down our working areas. Then, I learned how to make the specialty ice creams. Similar to a barista, I used an ice machine to make our ice cream, wiped down the equipment after, refilled toppings, served the ice cream to customers, and prepared to go ice cream orders. I then became a server. I memorized our kitchen menu, learned how to input orders through our computers, seated customers, served food and drinks, learned to calculate prices and tip, refilled sauces, cleaned bathrooms, and wiped down the tables and floor. I would switch between all three roles when working and would work both morning and night shifts while handling school.<br><br>

        I also worked with my sister, as she opened her own small business on the side during the pandemic. To help support herself for school, my sister decided to open a donut business at home. She made a new menu about every other week, while keeping her most popular flavors and adding new flavors. She would make new recipes based on a sweet and savory palette, which I helped her with the actual recipe making process and also the baking process. I would help advertise on social media and made the forms where customers would preorder for the week. I was also in charge of counting money, counting our inventory, and making sure we calculated change correctly. After the business had more publicity, we were invited to sell donuts at local pop ups for events. There, I was in charge of taking customers' orders, writing receipts, and counting how much money we made by the end of the day.
